{"prompt": "A brief history of time ", "output1": "A brief history of time \nThe Earth's spin period (corresponding to the length of a day) is an important measure of its motion relative to the overall universe. Because the Earth orbits the Sun, the Sun moves relative to other objects in the universe. This means the Earth's spin axis is constantly tilted; this is why the Earth's axis does not point directly away from the Sun, nor exactly towards the Sun.\n\nThese relative motions, viewed in proper coordinates in our world", "output2": "A brief history of time \n======================\n\nThe study of circadian rhythms or circadian clocks has a long history. The first study on the circadian clock was published in 1833 by the distinguished Harvard scientist Elisha Gray in which he described the presence of a circadian rhythm in the eclosion of male flies. In 1878, Jean Louis Pierre Ja\u00efs described a similar rhythm in *Drosophila*^[@bib1]^ and in 1879, W", "output3": "A brief history of time \n\nThere is a very broad range of definitions employed for the concept of time.  At the most basic and intuitive level, we experience time as being sequential as every new object in the universe is the same distance and the same time (in relation to the observer) from a previous object.  In this way the temporal direction is clearly a directional attribute of the universe.  That we experience this direction is a very convenient attribute for our limited brains - it is easy", "output4": "A brief history of time \n\nThe term is derived from  (prae tigitatum) which in turn is from Pr\u00e6cipe tigitare (\"to make a record of time\"), from past participle of, \"to cut, divide\".\n\nThe introduction of mechanical clocks in the late 17th century has led to a more precise understanding of time as opposed to the more general division of a day.\n\nDefinition in different cultures \n\nIn modern", "rating1": "6", "rating2": "6", "rating3": "6", "rating4": "6"}
