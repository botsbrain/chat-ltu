Once upon a time, there was a family with one son named John. One day, John was just walking around his house with his mother and father when there was a noise like a tornado in the sky. Out of shock, John fell down suddenly. The noise in the sky is the sound of the ground moving, which indicated that there are a group of aliens who landed on the ground of Earth. Then the aliens came out and surrounded John and his family. At last, the aliens used some technology on John and his family to turn them into a different person. John then noticed that he was no longer a boy, he had","A story about a world where the gravity gradually disappears and the people of the planet struggle to survive.

This is a story about a universe that is expanding and the consequence of this for the people of the earth whose life expectancies have been drastically reduced.

It was the early 80’s and I watched my father’s show on a small black and white color TV. It was on one of those infomercials (not one of those home improvement ones, but one of those car commercials that you could really live in. This show was the best: a giant, inflatable, black balloon filled with a thousand colorful jelly beans), it had a giant ball attached to it. When you inflated the balloon, it would slowly come to life and grow until it was the size of a small room. When you pulled the balloon back, the jelly beans exploded",,,2022-12-27 12:36:59.113350
